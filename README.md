This project presents a responsive web page to manage home lighting, where you can turn on the lights of each room individually. In the same way, it is possible to program an automatic switch-on schedule.

Also, it includes a counter that shows the rooms with lights on at the time of consultation. The rooms are represented by means of icons to speed up the interaction and improve the user experience and, in addition, the use of images was sought with respect to the context of the screens for a simpler understanding of the page.
